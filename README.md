# MVC Movie App
ASP.NET Core app built with a tutorial from Microsoft (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc). The app basically implements the MVC architectural pattern by displaying some movies (View) that were fetched via a browser request (Controller) from a database (Model).
